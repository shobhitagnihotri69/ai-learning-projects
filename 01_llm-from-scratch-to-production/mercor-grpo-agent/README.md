## What is this folder?

This folder implements the **3 core algorithm changes** from the Mercor + SkyRL paper on top of an existing GRPO agent baseline (`swe_in_prod_vizuara_01`). 

**The purpose is to:**
1. Understand *why* standard GRPO breaks for multi-turn agents.
2. Implement the exact 3 fixes Mercor used to train a 397B model.
3. Compare the old code vs. the new code side-by-side with explanations.

## What did Mercor actually DO?

Mercor took an open-source LLM (Qwen3.5-397B), and used **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to train it to do complex office work:
- Read PDFs with 50 pages.
- Search through emails.
- Write PowerPoint presentations.
- Do legal research.

They did this using a method called **GRPO** (Group Relative Policy Optimization), which is a variant of the famous **PPO** algorithm that powers ChatGPT.

Their results:
- **+70% relative improvement** in task success rate on the APEX-Agents benchmark.
- The model went from solving 16% of knowledge work tasks to solving **27%**.

All of that came from just **3 surgical fixes** to the standard RL algorithm.

## The Problem: Why Standard GRPO Breaks for Agents

Imagine you're training an agent on SWE-bench (GitHub bug-fix tasks). Your agent runs 6 different rollouts (attempts) at fixing the same bug, and they look like this:

```
Rollout 0: Wrote 3 bash commands, patched the file → 200 tokens total, reward = 0.85 ✅
Rollout 1: Rambled for 15 commands, wandered around, gave up → 3,500 tokens total, reward = 0.0 ❌
Rollout 2: Wrote 2 bash commands, patched the file → 180 tokens total, reward = 0.72 ✅
Rollout 3: Ran out of turns, no patch produced → 800 tokens total, reward = 0.0 ❌
Rollout 4: Explored correctly, patched → 350 tokens total, reward = 0.91 ✅
Rollout 5: Rambled for 20 commands → 5,000 tokens total, reward = 0.0 ❌
```

With standard GRPO, the **gradient is dominated by the rambling rollouts** because they have the most tokens. The model "learns" from rollouts 1, 3, and 5 more than from rollouts 0, 2, and 4. That's backwards! The model should learn most from the SHORT, SUCCESSFUL rollouts.

This is the fundamental problem Mercor identified and solved.

## The 3 Mercor Fixes (What We Implement)

### Fix 1: `prompt_mean` Token Aggregation (+3.9 points in the paper)

**The problem with the old code (line 165 of `swe_grpo_one_step.py`):**
```python
# OLD: "token_mean" — the long rambling rollouts dominate everything
loss = -(a.to(device) * lp) / len(group)
```

When `lp` (log probability) is computed in `seq_logprob()`, it's the **sum of all token log probs divided by number of tokens**. A 5,000-token rollout with zero advantage contributes 10x more gradient noise than a 500-token successful rollout.

**The Mercor fix:**
```python
# NEW: "prompt_mean" — every rollout counts equally regardless of length
# Step 1: Compute per-token loss (NOT averaged yet)
# Step 2: Sum over each rollout's tokens
# Step 3: Divide by that rollout's OWN token count (normalize within)
# Step 4: Average across the group
loss = -sum(advantage_i * (sum_of_token_logprobs_i / n_tokens_i) for each rollout) / group_size
```

This is called `prompt_mean` because we normalize by prompt group, not global token count.

---

### Fix 2: Context Nudge — Harness Engineering (+3.0 points in the paper)

**The problem:**

In the original `run_agent()` function, the agent just runs until it hits `MAX_TURNS`. If the task is complex, the model might still be in the middle of exploring when it suddenly gets cut off. The trajectory ends, the reward is 0 (no patch produced), and the model gets punished for running out of turns.

This is not a *model failure*. It's a *harness failure*. The model never knew time was running out.

**The Mercor fix:**

Inject a warning message when 80% of the turn budget is consumed:
```python
# At turn 3 out of 4 (MAX_TURNS=4), inject this:
context.append({
    "role": "user",
    "content": "[SYSTEM ALERT]: You have 1 turn remaining. "
               "Stop exploring. Produce your FINAL patch immediately."
})
```

This bought Mercor **+3.0 points** with zero training cost. It's a pure harness fix.

---

### Fix 3: DPPO — Decoupled Proximal Policy Optimization

**The problem:**

In standard GRPO (and the original `swe_grpo_one_step.py`), we use REINFORCE:
```python
loss = -(advantage * log_prob)
```

When the model is updated across multiple gradient steps or in async training (where rollouts arrive from an older policy version), the current policy might have **drifted far** from the rollout policy. Updating on stale rollouts can destabilize training.

**The Mercor fix (DPPO from paper [8]):**

Calculate the **token-level importance ratio** between current and old policy:

$$r_t = \exp(\log \pi_\theta(x_t) - \log \pi_{\text{old}}(x_t))$$

Then mask out (zero out) tokens where the divergence exceeds a threshold $\delta$:

```python
# If the current policy has drifted too far from rollout policy, skip this token
ratio = (current_logprob - rollout_logprob).exp()
total_variation_mask = (ratio - 1).abs() < delta   # keeps only stable tokens
loss = -(advantage * token_logprobs * total_variation_mask).sum() / mask.sum()
```

This prevents catastrophic divergence during multi-turn agent training.
