# Build DeepSeek from Scratch

A hands-on guide to understanding and implementing the key architectural innovations behind DeepSeek — **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**, **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**, **Multi-Token Prediction**, and **RL-based training (GRPO)**.

This book and repository provide a hands-on guide to understanding and implementing the key architectural innovations behind DeepSeek.

### Official YouTube Series

This book is accompanied by our viral "Build DeepSeek from Scratch" YouTube playlist, which has helped researchers, developers, and entrepreneurs worldwide. We highly recommend watching the videos alongside reading the chapters for a comprehensive learning experience.

### About This Book

DeepSeek LLM represents a pivotal moment in open source recently as the first fully open-weights model to achieve state-of-the-art performance comparable to closed-source giants. This book democratizes the knowledge behind this breakthrough, teaching you the nuts and bolts of how every single aspect of DeepSeek was built from the ground up.

You will learn to implement and extend DeepSeek's core modules from scratch, including:

- **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**
- **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)**
- **Advanced Training and Fine-Tuning Pipelines (FP8, SFT, RL, Distillation)**

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapter. Each `chXX/` directory contains the `README.md` with a summary and links to relevant videos, and a subdirectory with the code listings (`.ipynb` notebooks) for that chapter.

- **/ch01/**: Introduction to the DeepSeek.
- **/ch02/**: The Road to MLA: Understanding the KV Cache Bottleneck.
- **/ch03/**: The DeepSeek Breakthrough: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA).
- **/ch04/**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in DeepSeek.
- **/ch05/**: Multi-Token Prediction and FP8 Quantization.
- **/ch06/**: The DeepSeek Training Pipeline.
- **/ch07/**: Post Training: SFT and Reinforcement Learning. Includes the runnable [minimal GRPO + RLVR code](ch07/01_main-chapter-code/grpo_rlvr_minimal.py).
- **/ch08/**: Knowledge Distillation.

We hope you find this resource valuable on your journey to mastering modern LLM architecture!
